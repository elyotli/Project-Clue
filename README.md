News Ketchup
============

**News Ketchup's** purpose is to help users of the app rid themselves of moments of being left out of a conversation due to ignorance of today's trending news topics.


# How It Works:
1. First, News Ketchup pulls the latest headline news articles from multiple reputable news sources.
2. To determine how popular (trending) each article is, we cross-check the article's keywords on twitter and facebook and calculating popularity by number of favorites, tweets, retweets, shares, and likes.
3. The four most popular topics are saved to the database and images for these topics are displayed on the landing page.
4. We then pull all articles from all news sources based on these four trending topics, sort them again by popularity, and display the four most popular articles per keyword on the main page.
5. We also utilize Google Trends API to populate our graph representing popularity of each topic over time.
